                <h2> About Me: </h2>
                <p>
                I am an Arts and Entertainment Technology major in University of Texas at Austin. I've always been
                interested in design and its positive effect on people, especially in terms of their user experience.  
                I want to become a UX/UI designer to create a better experience for everyone. My interest in UX Research and UI Design 
                all started with one of my first PC games, League of Legends. When I played League, I was able to feel emotionally different
                and experienced excitement and intensity I couldn't experience in everyday setting.   

                I want to provide that type of undescriable experience with products and services of our lives.

            <p> Some of my hobbies include playing video games, especially League of Legends. 
                I also like other games like Super Smash Brawl, Subnautica, and Overwatch. I like drawing and
                animating using my drawing tablet in my free time. I also really love spicy food- even if my stomach goes 
                through a wild ride.
